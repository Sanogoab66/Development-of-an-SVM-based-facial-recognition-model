# Development-of-an-SVM-based-facial-recognition-model
The goal of this project is to build a face recognition system based on the SVM classifier. For this, we have after preparation of the database, done some pre-processing like face detection, face cropping, feature extraction using gradient oriented histograms and then SVM classification.  In the second part, we repeated the steps but this time by building a model of PMC which are better in image processing.
